#### **Autograd**

Automatic gradient. It implements backpropagation.

#### **Backpropagation**

Backpropagation. Allows us to efficiently evaluate the gradient of some kind of a loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network. And what that allows us to do is then we can iteratively tune the weights of that neural network to minimize the loss function and therefore improve the accuracy of the model.
